<p>Titanium is a chemical element; it has symbol Ti and atomic number 22. Found in nature only as an
oxide, it can be reduced to produce a lustrous transition metal with a silver color, low density, and high
strength, resistant to corrosion in sea water, aqua regia, and chlorine.
Titanium was discovered in Cornwall, Great Britain, by William Gregor in 1791 and was named by Martin
Heinrich Klaproth after the Titans of Greek mythology. The element occurs within a number of minerals
principally rutile and ilmenite, which are widely distributed in the Earth's crust and lithosphere; it is found
in almost all living things, as well as bodies of water, rocks, and soils.[9] The metal is extracted from its
principal mineral ores by the Kroll and Hunter processes.[10] The most common compound, titanium
dioxide, is a popular photocatalyst and is used in the manufacture of white pigments.[11] Other
compounds include titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), a component of smoke screens and catalysts; and
titanium trichloride (TiCl3), which is used as a catalyst in the production of polypropylene.[9]

<P>
    As a metal, titanium is recognized for its high strength-to-weight ratio.[14] It is a strong metal with low
    density that is quite ductile (especially in an oxygen-free environment),[9] lustrous, and metallic-white in
    color.[16] Due to its relatively high melting point (1,668 °C or 3,034 °F) it has sometimes been described
    as a refractory metal, but this is not the case.[17] It is paramagnetic and has fairly low electrical and
    thermal conductivity compared to other metals.[9] Titanium is superconducting when cooled below its
    critical temperature of 0.49 K.

<!--chemical propeties-->
<P>Like aluminium and magnesium, the surface of titanium metal and its alloys oxidize immediately upon  
    exposure to air to form a thin non-porous passivation layer that protects the bulk metal from further
    oxidation or corrosion.[9] When it first forms, this protective layer is only 1–2 nm thick but it continues to
    grow slowly, reaching a thickness of 25 nm in four years.[23] This layer gives titanium excellent resistance
    to corrosion against oxidizing acids, but it will dissolve in dilute hydrofluoric acid, hot hydrochloric acid,
    and hot sulfuric acid.
