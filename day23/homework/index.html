    World War II[b] or the Second World War (1 September 1939 – 2 September 1945) was a global
    conflict between two major alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers. The vast majority of the world's
    countries, including all the great powers, fought as part of these military alliances. Many
    participating countries invested all available economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities into this
    total war, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role,
    enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and delivery of the only two nuclear weapons
    ever used in war. It was by far the deadliest conflict in history, resulting in 70–85 million fatalities.
    Millions died due to genocides, including the Holocaust, as well as starvation, massacres, and
    disease. In the wake of Axis defeat, Germany, Austria, and Japan were occupied, and war crime
    tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.

    The causes of the war are debated; contributing factors included the rise of fascism in Europe, the
    Spanish Civil War, the Second Sino-Japanese War, Soviet–Japanese border conflicts, and tensions
    in the aftermath of World War I. World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September
    1939, when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland. The United Kingdom and France
    declared war on Germany on 3 September. Under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939,
    Germany and the Soviet Union had partitioned Poland and marked out their "spheres of influence"
    across Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Romania. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series
    of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe in a
    military alliance called the Axis with Italy, Japan, and other countries. Following the onset of
    campaigns in North and East Africa, and the fall of France in mid-1940, the war continued primarily
    between the European Axis powers and the British Empire, with the war in the Balkans, the aerial
    Battle of Britain, the Blitz of the UK, and the Battle of the Atlantic. In June 1941, Germany led the
    European Axis powers in an invasion of the Soviet Union, opening the Eastern Front, the largest
    land theatre of war in history.

    Japan aimed to dominate East Asia and the Asia-Pacific, and by 1937 was at war with the Republic
    of China. In December 1941, Japan attacked American and British territories with near-
    simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific, including an attack on
    Pearl Harbor which resulted in the United States and the United Kingdom declaring war against
    Japan. The European Axis powers declared war on the US in solidarity. Japan soon conquered
    much of the western Pacific, but its advances were halted in 1942 after losing the critical Battle of
    Midway; Germany and Italy were defeated in North Africa and at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union. Key
    setbacks in 1943—including German defeats on the Eastern Front, the Allied invasions of Sicily and
    the Italian mainland, and Allied offensives in the Pacific—cost the Axis powers their initiative and
    forced them into strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded German-
    occupied France, while the Soviet Union regained its territorial losses and pushed Germany and its
    allies back. During 1944–1945, Japan suffered reversals in mainland Asia, while the Allies crippled
    the Japanese Navy and captured key western Pacific islands. The war in Europe concluded with the
    liberation of German-occupied territories; the invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the
    Soviet Union, culminating in the Fall of Berlin to Soviet troops; Hitler's suicide; and the German
    unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. Following the refusal of Japan to surrender on the terms of
    the Potsdam Declaration, the US dropped the first atomic bombs on Hiroshima on 6 August and
    Nagasaki on 9 August. Faced with imminent invasion of the Japanese archipelago, the possibility of
    more atomic bombings, and the Soviet Union's declared entry into the war against Japan on the eve
    of invading Manchuria, Japan announced on 10 August its intention to surrender, signing a
    surrender document on 2 September 1945.

    World War II changed the political alignment and social structure of the world, and it set the
    foundation for the international order for the rest of the 20th century and into the 21st century. The
    United Nations was established to foster international cooperation and prevent conflicts, with the
    victorious great powers—China, France, the Soviet Union, the UK, and the US—becoming the
    rival superpowers, setting the stage for the Cold War. In the wake of European devastation, the
    influence of its great powers waned, triggering the decolonisation of Africa and Asia. Most countries
    whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery and expansion.

<h2>Start and end dates</h2>

<p>
    World War II began in Europe on 1 September 1939[1][2] with the German invasion of Poland and the United
    Kingdom and France's declaration of war on Germany two days later on 3 September 1939. Dates for the
    beginning of the Pacific War include the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War on 7 July 1937,[3][4] or the
    earlier Japanese invasion of Manchuria, on 19 September 1931.[5][6] Others follow the British historian A. J. P.
    Taylor, who stated that the Sino-Japanese War and war in Europe and its colonies occurred simultaneously, and
    the two wars became World War II in 1941.[7] Other theorised starting dates for World War II include the Italian
    invasion of Abyssinia on 3 October 1935.[8] The British historian Antony Beevor views the beginning of World
    War II as the Battles of Khalkhin Gol fought between Japan and the forces of Mongolia and the Soviet Union
    from May to September 1939.[9] Others view the Spanish Civil War as the start or prelude to World War II.[10][11]

    The exact date of the war's end also is not universally agreed upon. It was generally accepted at the time that
    the war ended with the armistice of 15 August 1945 (V-J Day), rather than with the formal surrender of Japan on
    2 September 1945, which officially ended the war in Asia. A peace treaty between Japan and the Allies was
    signed in 1951.[12] A 1990 treaty regarding Germany's future allowed the reunification of East and West
    Germany to take place and resolved most post–World War II issues.[13] No formal peace treaty between Japan
    and the Soviet Union was ever signed,[14] although the state of war between the two countries was terminated
    by the Soviet–Japanese Joint Declaration of 1956, which also restored full diplomatic relations between
    them.[15]
