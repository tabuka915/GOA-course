<p><b>history about dodge</b></p>


<p>
    Dodge is an American brand of automobiles and a division of Stellantis North America, based in Auburn
    Hills, Michigan. Dodge vehicles have historically included performance cars, and for much of its existence
    Dodge was Chrysler's mid-priced brand above Plymouth.

<p>
    Founded as the Dodge Brothers Company machine shop by brothers Horace Elgin Dodge and John
    Francis Dodge in the early 1900s,[2] Dodge was originally a supplier of parts and assemblies to Detroit-
    based automakers like Ford. They began building complete automobiles under the "Dodge Brothers" brand
    in 1914, predating the founding of the Chrysler Corporation. The factory located in Hamtramck, Michigan
    was the Dodge main factory from 1910 until it closed in January 1980. John Dodge died from the Spanish
    flu in January 1920, having lungs weakened by tuberculosis 20 years earlier.[3] Horace died in December of
    the same year, perhaps weakened by the Spanish flu, but the cause of death was cirrhosis of the liver.
    Their company was sold by their families to Dillon, Read & Co. in 1925 before being sold to Chrysler in
    1928.

    Dodge's mainstay vehicles were trucks, full-sized passenger cars through the 1970s, and it also built
    compact cars such as the 1963–76 Dart and midsize as well as such as the "B-Body" Coronet and Charger
    from 1965 until 1978.

    The 1973 oil embargo caused American "gas guzzler" sales to slump, prompting Chrysler to develop the
    Dodge Aries K platform compact and midsize cars for the 1981 model year. The K platform and its
    derivatives are credited with reviving Chrysler's business in the 1980s. One example was the Dodge
    Caravan. During the 1990s the Dodge Stratus found many buyers along with the larger Dodge Intrepid.

<p>The Dodge brand endured multiple ownership changes at Chrysler from 1998 to 2009, including its merger
    with Daimler-Benz AG from 1998 to 2007,[4] its subsequent sale to Cerberus Capital Management, its 2009
    bailout by the United States government, and its subsequent Chapter 11 bankruptcy and acquisition by

<strong>Horace and John Dodge founded the Dodge Brothers Company in Detroit in 1900, and
    quickly found work manufacturing precision engine and chassis components for the city's
    growing number of automobile firms. Chief among them were the established Olds Motor
    Vehicle Company and the new Ford Motor Company. Henry Ford selected the Dodge
    brothers to supply a wide range of components for his original Model A (1903–04) comprising
    the entire chassis: Ford needed to add only the body and wheels to finish the cars.[5] Henry
    offered the Dodge brothers a 10% share in his new company in return for $10,000 worth of
    goods ($366,240 in 2023 dollars [6]). In 1902, the brothers won a contract to produce
    transmissions for Ransom E. Olds' company, Oldsmobile upon which they built a solid
    reputation for quality and service. They rejected a second contract from Oldsmobile in 1903,
    to retool their plant to manufacture engines for the Ford Motor Company, which would be in
    debt to the brothers.

    The first machine shop where the brothers worked as parts suppliers for Olds and Ford was
    located at the Boydell Building on Beaubien Street at Lafayette. This location was replaced by a larger facility at Hastings Street and Monroe Avenue,
    which is now a parking garage for the Hollywood Casino (Hastings Street at this location has been renamed Chrysler Service Drive).[7] By 1910 the
    Dodge Main factory was built in Hamtramck, where it remained until 1979.
